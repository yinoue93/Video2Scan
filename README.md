We introduce a system which takes a video of a document to be scanned as its input and outputs a set of images that correspond to the document pages. These images could then be converted to a single pdf file. Unlike the earlier works, not only does the system recognize each page flips and rectifies the pages, it also applies a series of image enhancements to improve the output image quality. The system also contains a false positive mechanism to remove any duplicate images. As taking a video takes significantly less time than scanning each page at a time using traditional methodologies, this greatly reduces the amount of time and mental pain that a user must go through when scanning documents.
